## Parameters used to make the simulations
##			1) Population Structure
##				--subgroups of the genotype file
##				-- +/- kinship
##				Q : Population Structure
##				K : Kinship
##			2) Heritability
##				--noise higher heritability is more noise
##	Start with 4 datasets with a range of the kinship (yes/no) and heritability (1-6)
##
##
## Also need to look at effect sizes
##
## We want to see at what point the effect size produces signal (relative to the heritability)
